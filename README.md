# FTCM

**FTCM** (FinTech Common) is a common Kotlin library for FinTech applications, built on top of the Spring Framework (which the majority of commercial banks currently use).

## Scope: What it implements and what it does not

1. This repository is a **pure foundational library**.  
   It sits on top of the Spring ecosystem while below the financial business/domain logic layer.

2. The library primarily focuses on **commercial loans**.  
   Other areas such as debit cards, payments, trading, equities and similar retail-banking functions are **out of scope** and will not be implemented.

## COPYRIGHT NOTICE

**⚠️ STRICT COPYRIGHT & USAGE RESTRICTION**

This library is **strictly prohibited** from being used in **any** projects — whether personal, internal, or commercial — without explicit written permission from the author.
